#Recurring Invoices
Recurring invoice is a sophisticated system which saves hours of
effort entering the same invoices for each period. Once 
the invoice details are entered they are never forgotten and are 
billed on time and for the correct amounts. Recurring Invoicing 
records details of contracts, including start, end and review dates. 
Invoices may include hours/quantities multiplied by a rate or simple 
value amounts. Each contract can be billed daily, on a particular day
of the week, e.g. every friday, or on the same day of every month, 
the same date every year or according to user-defined calendars or 
dates relative to the last invoice date. This gives complete 
flexibility to invoicing schedules.
