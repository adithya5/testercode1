##Why PostgreSQL Server?

MixERP is **PostgreSQL-only ERP** and **we will not support** any other DBMS anytime soon in the near future. However, we fully support compatible PostgreSQL forks such as [PostgreSQL Plus Advanced Server](http://www.enterprisedb.com/).

We have been receiving tons of queries on why PostgreSQL? We chose PostgreSQL Server because:

* PostgreSQL is platform independent.
* We have plans to support Apache and nginx.
* We support *nix based operating system.
* PostgreSQL is free no matter how big your data grows, unlimited processors, unlimited cores, unlimited memory. You will never be forced to upgrade to higher version due to a limitation of database size or similar.
* PostgreSQL is an [excellent choice for enterprise application](http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Hot-skills-PostgreSQL).
* PostgreSQL does have [paid support plans](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2617783/open-source-software/the-stealth-success-of-postgresql.html) for enterprises.
* PostgreSQL is [ahead of commercial database](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2608863/nosql/postgresql-ramps-up-its-nosql-game.html) vendors in terms of development. Also see [this](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/What%27s_new_in_PostgreSQL_9.0), [this](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/What%27s_new_in_PostgreSQL_9.1), [this](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/What%27s_new_in_PostgreSQL_9.2), [this](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/What%27s_new_in_PostgreSQL_9.3), and [this](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/What%27s_new_in_PostgreSQL_9.4). And [this](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/release-9-4-1.html) as well.
* We have been SQL Server developers long before we even knew PostgreSQL Server existed. We love SQL Server, but PostgreSQL is a better fit for, and brings added advantage to MixERP.

##You Dont Have to Bang Your Head to Learn or Implement MixERP

The first thing that we ever discussed when starting this project was simplicity. Designed from scratch, MixERP integrates most of the useful functionality of an average ERP solution with extra emphasis on simplification of its modules. Switching to MixERP from your previous ERP solution will not be a nightmare unlike in most cases with other ERP Solutions.

###MixERP Is a Pure
* multi-currency,
* multi-lingual, 
* and multi-establishment ERP Solution.

##MixERP Disallows Side Effecting Functionality

Unlike other ERP solutions, MixERP restricts some side effecting functionality. For example, modification of past dated transactions is not allowed. This ensures that you cannot have two different balance sheets of the same date because of the modifications made.
