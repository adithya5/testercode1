##You Dont Have to Bang Your Head to Learn or Implement MixERP

The first thing that we ever discussed when starting this project was simplicity. Designed from scratch, MixERP integrates most of the useful functionalities of an average ERP solution with extra emphasis on simplification of its modules. Switching to MixERP from your previous ERP solution will not be a nightmare unlike in most cases with other ERP Solutions.

##MixERP Disallows Side Effecting Functionality

Unlike other ERP solutions, MixERP restricts some side effecting functionality. For example, modification of past dated transactions is not allowed. This ensures that you cannot have two different balance sheets of the same date because of the modifications made. 

##MixERP is a pure
* multi-currency,
* multi-lingual, 
* and multi-establishment ERP Solution.

##MixERP Is Rich in Design

MixERP has a very wide range of features which are tightly integrated with each others. MixERP has a unique set of features that you will not find even in commercial ERP solution. Unlike other ERP solutions, MixERP simplifies business processes via automated financial tools such as:

* Central Database for Multiple Establishments.
* With a single instance of MixERP installation, you can operate multiple Office Groups and Offices under the hood. MixERP can consolidate and/or split reports on the fly--without needing a hacky lengthy procedure. 
* Policy engine for G/L access.
* Integrated workflow engine for transaction posting and verification.
* Automatic decisions by the system based upon your configuration.
* End of day (EOD) operation.
